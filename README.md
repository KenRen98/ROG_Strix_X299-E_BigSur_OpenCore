# ROG_Strix_X299-E_BigSur_OpenCore
<h3>OpenCore Configuration For X299-E Gaming:</h3>

1. This Configure is based on the instruction of khronokernel/OpenCore-Asus-X299
https://github.com/khronokernel/OpenCore-Asus-X299


2. Also Mostly from the Official OpenCore Instruction
https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config-HEDT/skylake-x.html#starting-point


3. The Configuration contains a AQC107 Kext Patch, remove it if you dont use 10G network Adopter it.
(in Kext Patch, you will see the AQC107 key, set enabled to False)


4. For BIOS setting, Please View:

<h4>I strongly recommend Recommend you use the v2002 BIOS, I tested other newer BIOS, just didnt work out.
Even with the FIX from khronokernel, older version somehow didnt work for me.</h4>

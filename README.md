<h3>OpenCore Configuration For X299-E Gaming:</h3>

1. This Configure is based on the instruction of khronokernel/OpenCore-Asus-X299</br>
https://github.com/khronokernel/OpenCore-Asus-X299


2. Also Mostly from the Official OpenCore Instruction</br>
https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config-HEDT/skylake-x.html#starting-point


3. The Configuration contains a AQC107 Kext Patch, remove it if you dont use 10G network Adopter it.</br>
(in Kext Patch, you will see the AQC107 key, set enabled to False)


4. For BIOS setting, Please View:</br>

<h4>I strongly recommend you use the v2002 BIOS, I tested other newer BIOS, just didnt work out.
Even with the FIX from khronokernel, newer version somehow didnt work for me.</h4>
